I was meaning to ask you if you saw the basketball game on friday.>>>I wanted to go, but I couldn't.
it was a great game.>>>it's too bad that I couldn't make it. who won?
our team played hard and won.>>>I really wish I went to the game.
it was the best game ever.>>>so tell me the final score.
the other team lost by three points, 101-98.>>>it must've been a close game.
it really was. you should've gone.>>>hopefully, i'll make it to the next one.
