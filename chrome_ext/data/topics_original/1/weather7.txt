A: I really want to go to the beach this weekend.

B: That sounds like fun. What's the weather going to be like?

A: I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.

B: Is it going to be perfect beach weather?

A: I believe so.

B: Good. I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.

A: I know. I really want to go to the beach.

B: But you know that California weather is really unpredictable.

A: You're right. One minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.

B: I really wish the weather would just stay the same.

A: I do too. That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.

B: Yeah, that would make things a lot easier.
