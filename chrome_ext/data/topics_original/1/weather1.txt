A: It's an ugly day today.

B: I know. I think it may rain.

A: It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.

B: That would be weird.

A: Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.

B: I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.

A: Yes, it would be. 

B: I really wish it wasn't so hot every day. 

A: Me too. I can't wait until winter.

B: I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.

A: I'd rather be cold than hot.

B: Me too.
