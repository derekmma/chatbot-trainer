A: Did you hear the news?

B: What happened?

A: Our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week.

B: She did? Why didn't anyone tell me?

A: I would've thought that somebody would have told you.

B: No, I had no idea.

A: Well, she did, her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.

B: Oh my God, that's great!

A: Are you going to go and visit her and the baby?

B: I think that I might.

A: Good! I just thought I'd let you know.

B: Thanks for telling me.
