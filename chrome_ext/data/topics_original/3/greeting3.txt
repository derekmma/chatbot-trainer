A: Hi Ron, please come in!

B: Good to see you, Malia. I love your house!

A: We are very lucky to be living in this house.

B: Have you lived here a long time?

A: This was my parents' house, so I grew up here.

B: It seems to be perfect for you.

A: Come on in and see the kitchen, and I'll get us both something to drink.

B: Great! It's such a hot day today, isn't it?

A: Would you like lemonade, iced tea, or mango juice?

B: I would love a nice glass of lemonade.
