You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?+++$+++Forget it.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---+++$+++Cameron.+++$+++The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.+++$+++Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Why?+++$+++Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.+++$+++That's a shame.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...+++$+++Let me see what I can do.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head+++$+++Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.+++$+++I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.+++$+++That's because it's such a nice one.+++$+++Forget French.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?+++$+++Well, there's someone I think might be --
There.+++$+++Where?
You got something on your mind?+++$+++I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You have my word.  As a gentleman+++$+++You're sweet.
How do you get your hair to look like that?+++$+++Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Sure have.+++$+++I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.+++$+++I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
She's not a...+++$+++Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.+++$+++So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?+++$+++Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Hi.+++$+++Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?+++$+++I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?+++$+++Tons
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".+++$+++I was?+++$+++You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...+++$+++Then that's all you had to say.+++$+++But+++$+++You always been this selfish?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."+++$+++No...
do you listen to this crap?+++$+++What crap?+++$+++Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.+++$+++Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.+++$+++What good stuff?+++$+++The "real you".+++$+++Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?+++$+++No+++$+++Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Wow+++$+++Let's go.
She okay?+++$+++I hope so.
They do to!+++$+++They do not!
Did you change your hair?+++$+++No.+++$+++You might wanna think about it
Where did he go?  He was just here.+++$+++Who?+++$+++Joey.
Great+++$+++Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.+++$+++Is he oily or dry?+++$+++Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.+++$+++Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?+++$+++All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.+++$+++I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?+++$+++I did.
It's more+++$+++Expensive?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?+++$+++Hopefully.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.+++$+++Queen Harry?+++$+++It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Neat...+++$+++My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.+++$+++Hi, Joey.+++$+++You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.+++$+++You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Where've you been?+++$+++Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.+++$+++Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?+++$+++It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.+++$+++Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?+++$+++What do you think?+++$+++I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.+++$+++What's normal?+++$+++Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?+++$+++At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.+++$+++It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?+++$+++Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
You are so completely unbalanced.+++$+++Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --+++$+++I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.+++$+++You're welcome.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.+++$+++Like you care.+++$+++I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .+++$+++I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?+++$+++What?+++$+++In 9th.  For a month+++$+++Why?+++$+++He was, like, a total babe+++$+++But you hate Joey+++$+++Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.+++$+++As in...
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.+++$+++You did what?+++$+++Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
But+++$+++After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --+++$+++Why didn't you tell me?+++$+++I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.+++$+++No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
That's not+++$+++I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.+++$+++I guess I thought I was protecting you.+++$+++God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself+++$+++Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.+++$+++I guess I'll never know, will I?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.+++$+++So did you
Let go!+++$+++You set me up.+++$+++I just wanted --+++$+++What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?+++$+++No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?+++$+++It's just you.
Patrick -- is that- a.+++$+++Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...+++$+++No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.+++$+++What if she never starts dating?+++$+++Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.+++$+++But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.+++$+++Exactly my point
Daddy, I --+++$+++And where're you going?+++$+++If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.+++$+++Otherwise known as an orgy?+++$+++It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Daddy, people expect me to be there!+++$+++If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God.  It's starting.+++$+++It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.+++$+++Daddy, no!+++$+++Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.+++$+++Why?+++$+++Because she'll scare them away.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --+++$+++The prom?  Kat has a date?+++$+++No, but+++$+++It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?+++$+++He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.+++$+++You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.+++$+++Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I'm missing something.+++$+++I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.+++$+++Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?+++$+++Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?+++$+++Never+++$+++Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?+++$+++Just sent 'em through.
You the new guy?+++$+++So they tell me...+++$+++I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Tons+++$+++North, actually.  How'd you   ?+++$+++I was kidding. People actually live there?+++$+++You always been this selfish?+++$+++How many people were in your old school?+++$+++Thirty-two.+++$+++Get out!+++$+++How many people go here?+++$+++Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.+++$+++Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.+++$+++Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.+++$+++Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.+++$+++That's not+++$+++I guess I'll never know, will I?+++$+++Let's go.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?+++$+++Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.+++$+++He always have that shit-eating grin?+++$+++Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You know French?+++$+++Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada+++$+++Guess who just signed up for a tutor?+++$+++You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?+++$+++You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.+++$+++That's her?  Bianca's sister?+++$+++The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.+++$+++Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
What about him?+++$+++You wanna go out with him?
What makes you think he'll do it?+++$+++He seems like he thrives on danger+++$+++No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...+++$+++They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?+++$+++I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.+++$+++Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?+++$+++Did she actually say she'd go out with you?+++$+++That's what I just said
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.+++$+++I thought you hated those people.+++$+++Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
You got him involved?+++$+++Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.+++$+++In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.+++$+++Will Bogey get bent?+++$+++Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one.  She hates smokers+++$+++It's a lung cancer issue+++$+++Her favorite uncle+++$+++Dead at forty-one.
He's pretty!+++$+++Okay!  I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.+++$+++It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.+++$+++Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.+++$+++The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?+++$+++Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.+++$+++No, I ' m not.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.+++$+++Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.+++$+++Yeah -- we'll see.
What've you got for me?+++$+++I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".+++$+++So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.+++$+++Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy+++$+++It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?+++$+++She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron -- do you like the girl?+++$+++Sure+++$+++Then, go get her
What'd you do to her?+++$+++I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote+++$+++She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?+++$+++She kissed me.+++$+++Where?
What's the worst?+++$+++You get the girl.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?+++$+++Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.+++$+++They're running the rest of me next month.
Hey -- do you mind?+++$+++Not at all
Where ya goin?+++$+++Away.+++$+++Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.+++$+++And why would I do that?
Yeah+++$+++What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...+++$+++Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.+++$+++Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.+++$+++You just said+++$+++You need money to take a girl out+++$+++But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.+++$+++You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?+++$+++I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.+++$+++How much?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.+++$+++Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.+++$+++Fifty, and you've got your man.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.+++$+++I'm on it+++$+++Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.+++$+++I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
I just upped my price+++$+++What?+++$+++A hundred bucks a date.+++$+++Forget it.+++$+++Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.+++$+++A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?+++$+++Do what?+++$+++Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --+++$+++Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Hey.+++$+++Are you lost?+++$+++Nope - just came by to chat+++$+++We don't chat.+++$+++Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.+++$+++We're not.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?+++$+++Does this conversation have a purpose?+++$+++So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.+++$+++Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*+++$+++You and Verona?+++$+++What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.+++$+++Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Who's that?+++$+++Patrick Verona   Random skid.+++$+++That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.+++$+++I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.+++$+++He always look so+++$+++Block E?
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.+++$+++Just a little.
What's this?+++$+++An attempted slit.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.+++$+++But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.+++$+++You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.+++$+++William would never have gone to a state school.+++$+++William didn't even go to high school+++$+++That's never been proven+++$+++Neither has his heterosexuality.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?+++$+++Does it matter?+++$+++If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
You think this'll work?+++$+++No fear.
What'd he say?+++$+++Who cares?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.+++$+++I didn't have a choice.+++$+++You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?+++$+++I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.+++$+++You didn't+++$+++I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?+++$+++Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .+++$+++Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.+++$+++Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway+++$+++You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.+++$+++Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Have you seen him?+++$+++Who?+++$+++William - he asked me to meet him here.+++$+++Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?+++$+++Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?+++$+++There's a way to get a guy's attention.+++$+++My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then+++$+++Oh, right.  Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.+++$+++Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?+++$+++I know a lot more than that
You hate me don't you?+++$+++I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.+++$+++Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.+++$+++And why would I do that?+++$+++Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...+++$+++You -- covered in my vomit.+++$+++Seven-thirty?
Are you following me?+++$+++I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.+++$+++Hi
You're not a big talker, are you?+++$+++Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
hey.  Great show, huh?+++$+++
Excuse me?+++$+++That's what you want, isn't it?+++$+++Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.+++$+++You know who The Raincoats are?+++$+++Why, don't you?
What's this?+++$+++"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?+++$+++I say, do what you wanna do.+++$+++Funny, you're the only one
Okay?+++$+++I'm fine. I'm
You're not okay.+++$+++I just need to lie down for awhile+++$+++Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep+++$+++I know, just let me sleep+++$+++What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
This is so patronizing.+++$+++Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.+++$+++Why 're you doing this?+++$+++I told you+++$+++You don't care if I die+++$+++Sure, I do+++$+++Why?+++$+++Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.+++$+++Like you could find one+++$+++See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?+++$+++Just let me sit down.
Why'd you let him get to you?+++$+++Who?+++$+++Dorsey.+++$+++I hate him.+++$+++I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.+++$+++Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?+++$+++I thought you were above all that+++$+++You know what they say
Kat! Wake up!+++$+++What?
And I'm in control of it.+++$+++But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?+++$+++Busy+++$+++Were you in jail?+++$+++Maybe.+++$+++No, you weren't+++$+++Then why'd you ask?+++$+++Why'd you lie?
I should do this.+++$+++Do what?+++$+++This.
Start a band?+++$+++My father wouldn't approve of that that+++$+++You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me?+++$+++I'm gettin' there
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?+++$+++He just wants me to be someone I'm not.+++$+++Who?+++$+++BIANCA+++$+++No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.+++$+++What are you doing here?+++$+++I heard there was a poetry reading.+++$+++You 're so --+++$+++Pleasant?
Wholesome.+++$+++Unwelcome.+++$+++Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.+++$+++Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.+++$+++So what did I have an effect on ?+++$+++Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.+++$+++Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.+++$+++C'mon.  It's not that bad+++$+++Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there --+++$+++Forget it.  I'm stayin'.+++$+++You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?+++$+++Maybe.
The Partridge Family?+++$+++I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.+++$+++Good call.+++$+++So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?+++$+++I dazzled him with my wit
A soft side? Who knew?+++$+++Yeah, well, don't let it get out+++$+++So what's your excuse?+++$+++Acting the way we do.+++$+++Yes+++$+++I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.+++$+++So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?+++$+++Something like that+++$+++Then you screwed up+++$+++How?+++$+++You never disappointed me.
You up for it?+++$+++For. . . ?
State trooper?+++$+++Fallacy.+++$+++The duck?+++$+++Hearsay.+++$+++I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.+++$+++I hate peas.+++$+++No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.+++$+++You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.+++$+++What?+++$+++No one else knows+++$+++You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?+++$+++Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command?+++$+++You know what I mean+++$+++No.+++$+++No what?+++$+++No, I won't go with you+++$+++Why not?+++$+++Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?+++$+++So I have to have a motive to be with you?+++$+++You tell me.+++$+++You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?+++$+++Answer the question, Patrick+++$+++Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?+++$+++It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?+++$+++It's just something I had.  You know+++$+++Oh huh+++$+++Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
My grandmother's .+++$+++What?+++$+++That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
That ' s completely adorable!+++$+++It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Wait I...+++$+++You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!+++$+++It wasn't like that.+++$+++Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?+++$+++I didn't care about the money.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?+++$+++I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.+++$+++Is that right?+++$+++Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?+++$+++Because I like to torture you.+++$+++Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?+++$+++Don ' t you even dare. . .
I know.+++$+++I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.+++$+++You decided.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?+++$+++Enough!
My insurance does not cover PMS+++$+++Then tell them I had a seizure.+++$+++Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?+++$+++I thought you were punishing me.+++$+++Why can't we agree on this?+++$+++Because you're making decisions for me.+++$+++As a parent, that's my right+++$+++So what I want doesn't matter?+++$+++You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.+++$+++I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Was that your sister?+++$+++Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.+++$+++Funny.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?+++$+++No, Daddy.+++$+++So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?+++$+++Parts of it.+++$+++Which parts?+++$+++The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.+++$+++Bianca did what?+++$+++What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?+++$+++No -- impressed.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.+++$+++When I go?+++$+++Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.+++$+++They do not!+++$+++Perm?+++$+++I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.+++$+++The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Tempestuous?+++$+++No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?+++$+++Just smack her now.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?+++$+++Hi.+++$+++Cool pictures.  You a fan?+++$+++Yeah.  I guess.
You think?+++$+++Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?+++$+++Right.+++$+++Kat a fan, too?+++$+++Yeah...
Say it+++$+++What?+++$+++Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?+++$+++The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.+++$+++What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.+++$+++Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.+++$+++So Dorsey can get the girl?+++$+++Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?+++$+++We're your guys.
What?!+++$+++Good enough.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?+++$+++Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?+++$+++Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.+++$+++I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?+++$+++No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.+++$+++Sweet love, renew thy force!+++$+++Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?+++$+++All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.+++$+++Cameron, I'm a little busy+++$+++Then, go get her
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?+++$+++Touch of the flu.+++$+++I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?+++$+++What's to discuss?+++$+++You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?+++$+++Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You're completely demented.+++$+++See you next week!
In the microwave.+++$+++Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?+++$+++Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?+++$+++Tumescent!+++$+++You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?+++$+++Pirate -- no question.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.+++$+++Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap+++$+++Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!+++$+++But -- who -- what --?
What just happened?+++$+++Your daughters went to the prom.+++$+++Did I have anything to say about it?+++$+++Absolutely not.+++$+++That ' s what I thought
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!+++$+++The water's going putrid in the barrels.+++$+++You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?+++$+++Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.+++$+++With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
He's the devil's child...+++$+++We'll all go crazy...
We should have seen land.+++$+++We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.+++$+++Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?+++$+++Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.+++$+++Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?+++$+++I am, Your Eminence+++$+++Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.+++$+++Excellency, you are right.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.+++$+++Your life, and that of others!+++$+++If they agree to follow me, yes.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.+++$+++Is that all that interests you? Gold?+++$+++No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?+++$+++Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?+++$+++Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.+++$+++IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...+++$+++The Judgment is ours!+++$+++Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?+++$+++Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.+++$+++On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
You can see for yourself.+++$+++What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...+++$+++A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I could be gone for years.+++$+++I know.+++$+++I haven't given you much of a life.+++$+++Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...+++$+++Are we going to argue?+++$+++I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...+++$+++I find that hard to believe.
She said yes.+++$+++Thank God...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.+++$+++I don't want you to wait for me.+++$+++That's something you can't decide.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.+++$+++You don't usually ask.+++$+++I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...+++$+++They tried... but I didn't let them.
They took everything...+++$+++Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Can't you stay with us a little?+++$+++I am busy inside.
What is it, now?  Tell me...+++$+++I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?+++$+++Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.+++$+++May I ask by whom?+++$+++Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.+++$+++Yes... I remember...
My letters of appointment.+++$+++Appointment to what?+++$+++Viceroy of the West Indies.+++$+++Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
How far from here?+++$+++I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.+++$+++How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.+++$+++I am afraid this is not the worst news.
I want to go with you!+++$+++There'll be a time.+++$+++You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?+++$+++Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I have to explore the mainland.+++$+++This time with me!
How are you feeling, Fernando?+++$+++Not bad.
Father...+++$+++There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What are you listening to?+++$+++I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
What does he say?+++$+++He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.+++$+++He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.+++$+++Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...+++$+++Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No...+++$+++No?+++$+++NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.+++$+++I'm not bargaining!+++$+++Then you are too ambitious.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?+++$+++If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...+++$+++Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
You defend yourself admirably...+++$+++... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.+++$+++Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.+++$+++Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.+++$+++What...?  Do I have so many already?+++$+++To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
All I have to do is call the guards.+++$+++Call them.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.+++$+++Look out of that window.
What do you see?+++$+++Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...+++$+++All of them created by people like me.
Say not here!  Cuba!+++$+++What is it?  A tribe?  An island?+++$+++Island.  Far.
You come!  You speak first!+++$+++Tell the Chief we thank him.+++$+++Chief knows.+++$+++Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief says -- how many?+++$+++Thousands.+++$+++Why?
To bring the word of God.+++$+++Chief says -- he has a God.+++$+++... and also to bring medicine.+++$+++Chief says...+++$+++He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?+++$+++He understands.+++$+++Ask him if he will help.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!+++$+++You did the same to your God!
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.+++$+++You never learned how to speak my language.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...+++$+++Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
God... That's in a week!+++$+++That's what it says.+++$+++How did you manage it?+++$+++With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Why do you wish to sail west?+++$+++To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.+++$+++Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.+++$+++How can you be so certain?+++$+++The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...+++$+++Esdras is a Jew.+++$+++So was Christ!
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.+++$+++I'll try to remember that, Marchena...+++$+++Father Marchena!+++$+++Passion is something one cannot control!+++$+++You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!+++$+++I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!+++$+++Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.+++$+++Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?+++$+++If God intends you to go, then you will go.+++$+++Damn God!
Colon!+++$+++Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
All of them!  Just lies!+++$+++Colon!  Don't!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.+++$+++Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
I am listening, my son.+++$+++Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.+++$+++What are you saying?+++$+++I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.+++$+++How long?+++$+++I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!+++$+++If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...+++$+++My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.+++$+++You are bound by an oath, Father.
I believed in you...+++$+++Give me absolution.
I suppose we're both old men now.+++$+++You'll always be older than me, Father.
I have to disagree.+++$+++I knew you would.+++$+++New worlds create new people.+++$+++Oh?  So you are a new man?+++$+++I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.+++$+++No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
The ocean is uncrossable?+++$+++What did they say about Granada before today?+++$+++That she was impregnable.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.+++$+++Surely you can do anything you want.
May I speak freely?+++$+++You show no inclination to speak otherwise!+++$+++I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...+++$+++A woman?
How old are you, Senor Colon?+++$+++Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Do they have such thoughts?+++$+++They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.+++$+++Thank you.+++$+++There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?+++$+++Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.+++$+++The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.+++$+++If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?+++$+++We don't need to know.+++$+++We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
We can't raise the wheel without it.+++$+++My horse doesn't work.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.+++$+++You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!+++$+++Savagery is what monkeys understand.+++$+++You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?+++$+++You will regret this.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...+++$+++God be with us admiral.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...+++$+++And what do you think Mendez?+++$+++Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.+++$+++Come over here.
What do you read?+++$+++Twenty eight.
What's he doing?+++$+++He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.+++$+++We can't be.
Where can I meet this man?+++$+++Immediately.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!+++$+++Six days ago, yes.+++$+++You must be mad...!+++$+++We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!+++$+++We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!+++$+++You think I don't know that?+++$+++We're lost!+++$+++The land is there.  I know it!+++$+++You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!+++$+++And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!+++$+++Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!+++$+++You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?+++$+++You bloody...+++$+++Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!+++$+++You tell that to them!+++$+++You're right.  Let the men decide.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?+++$+++Yes, Your Majesty.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.+++$+++Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
... Into a monk...+++$+++Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.+++$+++We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...+++$+++Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?+++$+++He must be replaced.+++$+++And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.+++$+++Then why?+++$+++Because he is not afraid of me.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.+++$+++I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.+++$+++Here.  I have your money.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!+++$+++Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?+++$+++He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Don't say anything.+++$+++Where are we going?+++$+++I'm coming with you.+++$+++Yes.  Yes, come with me!+++$+++I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.+++$+++You bring the cigarettes?+++$+++Oh, sure.
...delusions and paranoia.+++$+++I was all of these.+++$+++Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.+++$+++What about Oleg?+++$+++Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.+++$+++No, he is here.  Shit...+++$+++Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.+++$+++What about my movie rights?  Book rights?+++$+++Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.+++$+++What's your cut?  How much?+++$+++I would say...half.  Half is fair.+++$+++No.  No way.+++$+++But it's...+++$+++Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.+++$+++This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.+++$+++What else do you need?+++$+++I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.+++$+++Give me another one, please.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.+++$+++My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.+++$+++Your mother was blind?+++$+++Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.+++$+++Back in the Czech Republic?+++$+++Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...+++$+++Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?+++$+++Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
